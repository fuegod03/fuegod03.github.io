    <h3> Professional Photographer for the Moments that Matter
Your newborn’s tiny feet. His first home run. When she said yes. These are the moments that matter, and it’s my privilege to capture them in photos. I’m a professional photographer who’s passionate about capturing the thousands of little moments that add up to a lifetime. Whether they’re beach family photos, engagement pictures, or kids pictures, you’ll get more than a rigid, posed photo. You’ll have a lasting memory to make you smile. A real reminder of the days you never want to forget. </h3>

       “when you photograph people in black and white, you photograph their souls!”
     <h3> </h3>

<p>Black and White portraits are an incredible way to create family heirlooms. I photograph black and white photos  in a “studio” setting.  I have studied Black and White Photography right here in New York. It is truly my passion. For me it’s real human emotion being able to  photograph what the person is feeling at that moment in time. It doesn’t matter if your child’s hair isn’t perfect or if they just lost their first tooth – in black and white everything is perfect RAW emotion

     <h3>A beautiful reminder of your bundle of joy </h3>

<p>

  Couple´s photography, you can capture that incredible experience and share it with your family for years to come. We venture outdoors and wander someplace with beautiful natural surroundings. This is a completely informal and leisurely photography shoot.

     <h3>It’s Time for Proposal Pictures </h3>


     <p>During a free brainstorming consultation, we’ll determine the where, when, who, and how of your proposal. Once we establish the plan, you’ll receive a diagram and directions of the exact location, so when your day comes, all you have to do is arrive.

Sit back and relax as it all unfolds and we discreetly capture every second. We can also do the engagement session immediately following the proposal pictures, or schedule a separate engagement photo session at your convenience. Either way, you’re getting a couple photoshoot with one of the top engagement photographers, and you’ll be able to relive your proposal time and time again.
If you already have popped the question, and you want to document this exciting time in your lives, we can schedule an engagement session that will capture this moment. We will work with you on finding the best location.</p>

     <h3>Because they grow up too fast </h3>

<p>Let’s face it. When children are young, it’s easy to take things for granted. Maybe they were jumping on the bed instead of going to sleep. Perhaps they were busy making noise when you wanted to relax. But talk to any parent looking back on their life and they’ll tell you how much they miss their kids at those ages. Or how they wish they had taken more children pictures at their pivotal moments. With a kids photoshoot by Glenna, you’ll have child photography services ready whenever you want

     <h3> Capturing a lifetime of memories </h3>

<p>I get it. As adults, we’re not always crazy about getting our photo taken. We feel too “this” or not enough “that.” But if I would have known 20 ago how important it is to be in photos with my children, trust me, I would have made it happen more often. If I could go back and have professional family photos of my entire family in all different stages in life, I would. Maybe I can’t, but you can! You have a family photographer with her camera equipment ready anytime you are to capture generations of your family in the area’s most beautiful locations. </p>
