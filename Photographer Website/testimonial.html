<p> Tyler did an amazing job photographing my 4 year old daughter. It’s not easy getting a toddler to sit still and Tyler had a ton of patience and went above and beyond to accommodate her special needs. Her photos came out beautiful! I will definitely use Tyler for future photo shoots! </p>

<h3> Sarah B </h3>
<p> Tyler recently shot my labor & delivery – aside from the amazing pictures she took – she also got me through a really rough labor and took care of my husband who was just as nervous as I was. Tyler is able to capture feelings and emotions that you have no idea you even have until you see them through her eyes. I couldn’t be more grateful for Tyler’s work or her friendship.</p>
